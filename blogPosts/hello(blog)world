*first blog post*



Hello, everyone.


My name is Ryan Price and I'm a web developer in training.


I've recently been studying a lot of JavaScript. JavaScript is a core skill for any web developer, so it only seems natural to add it to my list of skills. Now, I have had a love/hate relationship with this
language (it was my first <3), but recently I have started to really enjoy the language.


I am by no means an expert at coding JavaScript. This became evident last night as I was finishing my "to do list" tutorial on Treehouse (interactive JavaScript pages I think?). I broke this fucking thing
so many times as I was building it (it's still broken, I have one more bug to fix @___@), but that's because I tried to code it the "hard way" (which I still feel I failed miserably at). The tutorial was the
first time I've felt that I really used HTML/CSS and JavaScript together in a synergistic way.


It was actually really fun to figure out how the different pieces worked together.


Some things that I learned would have to be:


  * The DOM is actually a magic node tree with it's roots planted deep inside the matrix, and jacking-in to it allows you to do magical things (using it's built in methods)

  * I really didn't understand events all that well -and truthfully still don't- but now they seem much less scary, and I know a few handy methods to utilize them.

  * The parent/child relationship is pretty fucking important. This may sound stupid, but I thought it was a way for people to *explain* the relationship between the different elements
      but, in reality it IS the relationship, and it's really a way to tell the DOM (using JS) what you want from it.

  * Querying the DOM, and grabbing elements and CSS selectors to manipulate seems to be a huge part of how the front end works, and this is why it is so important to understand HTML and CSS as well.

  * Methods within methods, or functions calling methods isn't all that scary. It can still be a lot to wrap your head around though.

  * That "this" can still confuse me... even though I thought I had it figured out.

  * My code is usually pretty ugly. I heard so much about how it would be, but I guess I finally saw what that looked like. Yeah, it's pretty ugly.

  * Everything in JavaScript is an object. Every HTML element is an object. The DOM is an object. Everything is probably an object.

  * I need to build more stuff.

Overall I feel really good having finished something like this. Part of still thinks that I took a shortcut -in a way- by having the nice british man walk me through the whole process. Still, I can't help feeling
that without the Treehouse tutorial, this would have taken a long time. I can't help but feel some sense of pride though, in the end. I took the time to break everything down into chunks and try to really
understand how everything works. Every method, every variable, everything.


Now, time to fix that bug.
