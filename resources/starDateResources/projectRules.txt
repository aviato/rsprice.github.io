The goal is to make an HTML5/CSS3 calendar app that will satisfy all these criteria:

    - Calendar must be responsive. I will probably need to use css media queries.

    - Current month will be displayed at the top of the containing div.

    - Days of each month will be contained in a small, bordered box.

    - Current day will be highlighted in some way (maybe with a red border).

    - Clicking a day will result in an expanded view that will show all pending

        to-do's and options to add or delete additional to-do's.

    - Days of the month that have passed will be grayed out.
    - Current time should be displayed somewhere obvious and visible on the calendar.
    - No colors other than gray, black, or white until the project is "complete".
    - Grid system should be proprietary.
    - Best practices should be striven for (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript)
    - Solid OOP principles should be applied if possible.
    - Demonstrate knowledge of closures / functional programming if possible.
    - A to-do list of some kind should be implemented as a feature.


Possible features:
    * weather?
    * to-dos
